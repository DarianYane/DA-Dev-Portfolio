                    The Employee Management System is a web-based application that allows companies to manage their employee data,

                    track department information and hiring metrics. The system is built using Django, a Python web framework, and
                    utilizes a PostgreSQL database for data storage.

                        proportion of pretty people, and a high proportion of not too happy people. This may be due to a problem with the sample
                        (small sample size or biased sample). It is recommended that more data be obtained before drawing conclusions.
