# What is included in this portfolio
I made this portfolio in order to get a job. You can see the deployed version at www.darianyane.com
In this site I explain the reasons for hiring me, show the projects I have created, tell you about my education and work experience, give you links to my social networks, and provide you with a contact form so we can arrange an interview.

## Reasons for hiring me
Here you will find the reasons why you should hire me as soon as possible.

## My projects
In this section you will find the access to the different projects I have worked on. You will find a text modifier to optimize reading and a travel blog (with CRUD, user management, etc.) among other projects.

### Fast-Reading
This application receives a .pdf and places the first two characters of each word in "bold" to make the text easier to read.

Fast-Reading facilitates the reading process by guiding the eyes through text with artficial fixation points. As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating how the extension works.

To optimize a file you do not need to download or install anything. You can do it directly from the project page. And if you don't have a .pdf file nearby, I provide one so you can test the project.

### Travel Blog
This travel blog is an improved version of the final work I did for my Python course at Coderhouse. It includes a CRUD for the posts and a user management system.

## About me
In this section you will find a description of my knowledge, experiences and objectives. You can also download my CV.

## Personal Roadmap
Here you will find the goals I have already accomplished, and my future plans as a developer (this section is dynamic and is fed from a database that I modify from the administration panel).

## Contact Form
