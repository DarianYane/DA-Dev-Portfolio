# What is included in this portfolio
I made this portfolio in order to get a job.
Here I explain the reasons for hiring me, show the projects I have created, tell you about my education and work experience, give you links to my social networks, and provide you with a contact form so we can arrange an interview.

## Reasons for hiring me
Here you will find the reasons why you should hire me as soon as possible.

## My projects
In this section you will find the access to the different projects I have worked on. You will find a text modifier to optimize reading and a travel blog (with CRUD, user management, etc.) among other projects.

### Fast-Reading
This application receives a .pdf and places the first two characters of each word in "bold" to make the text easier to read.

Below is a screenshot demonstrating how the extension works.

### Travel Blog
This travel blog is an improved version of the final work I did for my Python course at Coderhouse. It includes a CRUD for the posts and a user management system.

## About me
In this section you will find a description of my knowledge, experiences and objectives. You can also download my CV.
