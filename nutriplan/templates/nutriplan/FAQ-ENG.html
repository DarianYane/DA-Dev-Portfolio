                <h2>What is this application for?</h2>
                <p>This application allows you to generate a weekly diet plan with four meals a day, considering the physiological
                characteristics, objectives, and food preferences of each individual.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="m-5 pb-1">
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>The application guides you through a series of steps where you will be asked for information.</p>
                <p>In the first instance, the physiological data of the person is requested. Then a range of physical activity is requested
                to know the level of activity/sedentariness of the person. Finally, it is asked to indicate whether the is to gain
                muscle mass or to lose weight.</p>
                <p>This information is used to calculate the basal metabolic rate and maintenance calories, which are adjusted according to
                the desired goal to calculate the calories to be consumed daily.</p>
                <p>These calories are divided between carbohydrates, proteins and fats to establish a balanced target diet.</p>
                <p>In the following steps, the individual is asked to select some of his or her favorite foods to make the diet as
                attractive and personalized as possible. These foods are considered to be preferentially included in the diet. In case
                the user does not select any food as a favorite, the application will select foods at random.</p>
                <p>Once the favorite foods are selected, the application randomly selects the rest of the foods, and uses NUMPY's SOLVE
                function to solve a system of equations that satisfies the conditions of the target diet. If for some reason the process
                returns an error, it reselects another food group until a satisfactory answer is found.</p>
                <p>Finally, the weekly diet is presented. If the user is satisfied, he can print the menu. If they are not, they can repeat
                the process until they find a solution with which they are satisfied.</p>

                <h2>What problem does Nutriplan solve?</h2>
                <p>Nutriplan allows you to generate personalized diets quickly. In addition, its randomized food selection system prevents
                the person from abandoning the diet because it is monotonous; a new diet can be generated every week!</p>

            <div class="m-5 pb-1">
                <h2>How did the idea of Nutriplan come about?</h2>
                <p>A few years ago I used to work selling customized Excels as a freelancer.</p>
                <p>On one occasion, a nutritionist asked me to create an Excel file that would fulfill the functions mentioned above, in
                order to generate diets for his patients.</p>
                <p>After completing the job, it occurred to me that there might be a market for this product and I started selling it
                through MercadoLibre.com. To date I have sold more than 10. The difference between Excel and Nutriplan is that in Excel
                all the foods are manually selected.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="m-5 pb-1">
                <h2>Why do I include Nutriplan in my portfolio?</h2>
                <p>I think a project like Nutriplan has several features that demonstrate my skills with Python and its libraries.</p>
                <p>In addition to using a navigation bar, it was a good opportunity to place a carousel with images, use different types of
                data in the models, use forms with different types of data, use alerts if more than 3 favorite foods are selected per
                meal, use random variables and use NUMPY.</p>
                <p>However, the main reason I included Nutriplan is because it solves a REAL problem and could even be considered for
                commercial use.</p>

            <div class="m-5 pb-1">
                <h2>Why is Nutriplan in Spanish?</h2>
                <p>Because the food list used as a source of information is in Spanish (the original Excel is in Spanish). For this reason,
                and because the rest of the projects are in English, I thought that having a project in Spanish could be a good idea.</p>
